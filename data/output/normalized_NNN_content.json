      "interpersonal touch then may perform an influential part in the emotional well- being of the client and family. ebn: “ the goal of healing touch is to restore harmony and balance in the energy system, placing the client in a position to self-heal” ( drozdowicz & dillard, 2014 ). ebn: developing evidence suggested that there is biological support for the lessening of pain and anxiety for patients who receive chas in acute care settings ( kramlich, 2017 ). ebn: reiki can contribute to changes in mindfulness from conflict and confusion to harmony and well-being ( jamison & grohman, 2015 ). • refer to care plans for anxiety, acute pain, and chronic pain . guidelines for complimentary health approaches • cha may be practiced by anyone with the requisite preparation, desire, and commitment. ebn: acute and critical care nurses who are certified to practice cha in the acute care setting must adhere to their scope of practice, be conscious of their role, and recognize their professional boundaries ( kramlich, 2017 ). • volunteers who are not licensed health care professionals may practice in the home, but not in the health care setting unless they undertake a rigorous training program. ebn: because patient safety is of utmost concern in the acute and critical care settings, volunteer complimentary health professionals (chps) must support infection control, patient privacy, and patient security ( kramlich, 2017 ). pediatric • consider using chas for pediatric clients with adjunct therapies to decrease stress, anxiety, and pain. eb: mcclafferty et al (2017) encouraged medical professionals who care for children to foster the utilization of “relevant, safe, effective, and age-appropriate health services and therapies,” whether conventional or complementary. eb: in pediatric cases of pain and chronic conditions, the successful use of complementary alternative medicine (cam) has markedly increased ( adams et al, 2014 ). geriatric • consider chas for elderly with pain. eb: overall, cam therapies are valuable to the geriatric population, especially for those who cope with chronic conditions and suffer from constant pain, therefore enhancing their quality of life. cam nurtures good health practices and bolsters the body's defenses, its natural healing ability, and promotion of self-care and patient empowerment ( siddiqui et al, 2014 ). eb: the use of patient-centered communication about the risks/benefits of cam is necessary to promote effective management of chronic illnesses and pain among an aging population ( ho et al, 2014 ). multicultural • assess for the influence of cultural beliefs, norms, and values on the client's use of cam. eb: cams cover a wide range of methodologies (herbal medicine, manual healing techniques, traditional therapies, and mind–body interventions) and are used globally to treat a wide-range of illnesses and to support good health ( mathew et al, 2013 ). home care • help the client and family accept cams as natural healing interventions. eb: because homeopathy is one of the most commonly used methods of cam, schmacke, muller, and stamer (2014) , in their survey of homeopathic use, found that the initial homeopathic consultation and the search for appropriate medication was seen by patients as an endorsement of personalized homeopathic treatment. ▲ in the presence of a psychiatric disorder, refer for psychiatric home health care services for client reassurance and implementation of therapeutic regimens. eb: it has been shown that a home visit intervention (hovi) of psychiatric clients generates positive outcomes shown by the documented decrease in rehospitalization rates and number of days hospitalized, leading to health care cost savings ( chang & chou, 2015 ). client/family teaching and discharge planning • teach the client how to use guided imagery. ebn: urge your client to use guided imagery and relaxation. this nonpharmacological technique has proven valuable in treating sleep deprivation and the promotion of relaxation to reduce pain (adeola et al, 2015). • consider the use of progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training, relaxation response, biofeedback, emotional freedom technique, guided imagery, diaphragmatic breathing, transcendental meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness- based stress reduction, and emotional freedom technique. ceb: these are all evidence- based techniques that are easy to learn and practice and have good results in individuals with good health or with a disease ( varvogli & darviri, 2011 ). eb: “cam routines and rituals constitute key elements in cancer patients’ regular and satisfied cam use, and they promote familial strengthening” ( klafke et al, 2014 ). nurses/staff • the practice of cams, both giving and receiving, can improve well-being . ebn: the patient–cam practitioner connection is vital because it embodies healing intent, which in turn produces substantial influence on positive outcomes ( dunning, 2014 ). • see the evolve website for weblinks for client education resources. references adams d, whidden a, honkanea m. complementary and alternative medicine: a survey
