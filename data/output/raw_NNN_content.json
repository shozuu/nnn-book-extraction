EB: Alterations in blood pressure, HTN, and hypotension adversely affect cardiac function and myocardial oxygen consumption that can result in myocardial muscle injury. Nursing interventions to monitor cardiac function and reduce oxygen needs should be implemented along with continuous cardiac function monitoring ( ). • Clients with hypertensive crisis will require close monitoring for signs and symptoms consistent with acute renal failure, stroke, myocardial infarction, and acute heart failure. Many conditions may cause hypertensive crisis",
      "however, uncontrolled HTN is the most common cause. Subjective symptoms include severe headache, shortness of breath, faintness, and severe anxiety ( ). • Myxedema coma is an acute emergency associated with hypothyroidism that manifests with severe hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, seizures, and coma. Treatment focuses on supporting the client's blood pressure and restoring thyroid function by administering levothyroxine as prescribed, and supporting other organ systems ( ). • Thyroid storm (thyrotoxicosis) is an acute, life-threatening, hypermetabolic state induced by excessive release of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Symptoms are severe and include fever, tachycardia, HTN, congestive heart failure leading to hypotension and shock, profuse sweating, respiratory distress, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, jaundice, anxiety, seizures, and coma.

Provide education to empower the client to self-manage the disease associated with impaired gas exchange. • Assist the client and family in identifying other factors that precipitate or exacerbate episodes of ineffective breathing patterns (i.e., stress, allergens, stairs, activities that have high energy requirements). Awareness of precipitating factors helps clients avoid them and decreases the risk of ineffective breathing episodes ( ). • Assess client knowledge of and compliance with medication regimen. Client/family may need repetition of instructions received at hospital discharge and may require reiteration as fear of a recent crisis decreases. Fear interferes with the ability to assimilate new information. ▲ Refer the client for telemonitoring with a pulmonologist as appropriate, with use of an electronic spirometer or an electronic peak flowmeter . EB: A growing body of evidence shows that telemonitoring is both time and cost effective for the provider and client providing more timely continuity of care ( ). • Teach the client and family the importance of maintaining the therapeutic regimen and having as-needed drugs easily accessible at all times. Appropriate and timely use of medications can decrease the risk of exacerbating ineffective breathing. The 2017 GOLD Report states that bronchodilator medications are central to management of dyspnea ( ). • Provide the client with emotional support in dealing with symptoms of respiratory difficulty. Provide family with support for care of a client with chronic or terminal illness. Refer to care plan for Anxiety. Witnessing breathing difficulties and facing concerns of dealing with chronic or terminal illness can create fear in the caregiver. Fear inhibits effective coping ( ). • When respiratory procedures (e.g., apneic monitoring for an infant) are being implemented, explain equipment and procedures to family members, and provide needed emotional support. Family members assuming responsibility for respiratory monitoring often find this stressful. They may not have been able to assimilate fully any instructions provided by hospital staff ( ). • When electrically based equipment for respiratory support is being implemented, evaluate home environment for electrical safety, such as proper grounding. Ensure that notification is sent to the local utility company, the emergency medical team, and police and fire departments. Notification is important to provide for priority service. • Refer to GOLD guidelines for management of home care and indications of hospital admission criteria. • Support clients’ efforts at self-care. Ensure they have all the information they need to participate in care. • Identify an emergency plan including when to call your health care provider or 911. Having a ready emergency plan reassures the client and promotes client safety. ▲ Refer to occupational therapy for evaluation and teaching of energy conservation techniques. ▲ Refer to home health aide services as needed to support energy conservation. Energy conservation decreases the risk of exacerbating ineffective breathing . ▲ Institute case management of frail elderly to support continued independent living ( ).",

Inhaled steroids and bronchodilators can have undesirable side effects, especially when taken in inappropriate doses. • Teach client progressive muscle relaxation techniques. EB: Relaxation therapy may help reduce dyspnea and anxiety ( ). Benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation include reduction of anxiety and depression associated with COPD ( ). • Teach the client to identify and avoid specific factors that exacerbate ineffective breathing patterns, such as exposure to other sources of air pollution, especially smoking.

EBN: According to , the sense of touch has the potential of evoking and balancing human emotions",
      "interpersonal touch then may perform an influential part in the emotional well- being of the client and family. EBN: “ The goal of Healing Touch is to restore harmony and balance in the energy system, placing the client in a position to self-heal” ( ). EBN: Developing evidence suggested that there is biological support for the lessening of pain and anxiety for patients who receive CHAs in acute care settings ( ). EBN: Reiki can contribute to changes in mindfulness from conflict and confusion to harmony and well-being ( ). • Refer to care plans for . • CHA may be practiced by anyone with the requisite preparation, desire, and commitment. EBN: Acute and critical care nurses who are certified to practice CHA in the acute care setting must adhere to their scope of practice, be conscious of their role, and recognize their professional boundaries ( ). • Volunteers who are not licensed health care professionals may practice in the home, but not in the health care setting unless they undertake a rigorous training program. EBN: Because patient safety is of utmost concern in the acute and critical care settings, volunteer complimentary health professionals (CHPs) must support infection control, patient privacy, and patient security ( ). • Consider using CHAs for pediatric clients with adjunct therapies to decrease stress, anxiety, and pain. EB: encouraged medical professionals who care for children to foster the utilization of “relevant, safe, effective, and age-appropriate health services and therapies,” whether conventional or complementary. EB: In pediatric cases of pain and chronic conditions, the successful use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM) has markedly increased ( ). • Consider CHAs for elderly with pain. EB: Overall, CAM therapies are valuable to the geriatric population, especially for those who cope with chronic conditions and suffer from constant pain, therefore enhancing their quality of life. CAM nurtures good health practices and bolsters the body's defenses, its natural healing ability, and promotion of self-care and patient empowerment ( ). EB: The use of patient-centered communication about the risks/benefits of CAM is necessary to promote effective management of chronic illnesses and pain among an aging population ( ). • Assess for the influence of cultural beliefs, norms, and values on the client's use of CAM. EB: CAMs cover a wide range of methodologies (herbal medicine, manual healing techniques, traditional therapies, and mind–body interventions) and are used globally to treat a wide-range of illnesses and to support good health ( ). • Help the client and family accept CAMS as natural healing interventions. EB: Because homeopathy is one of the most commonly used methods of CAM, , in their survey of homeopathic use, found that the initial homeopathic consultation and the search for appropriate medication was seen by patients as an endorsement of personalized homeopathic treatment. ▲ In the presence of a psychiatric disorder, refer for psychiatric home health care services for client reassurance and implementation of therapeutic regimens. EB: It has been shown that a home visit intervention (HoVI) of psychiatric clients generates positive outcomes shown by the documented decrease in rehospitalization rates and number of days hospitalized, leading to health care cost savings ( ). • Teach the client how to use guided imagery. EBN: Urge your client to use guided imagery and relaxation. This nonpharmacological technique has proven valuable in treating sleep deprivation and the promotion of relaxation to reduce pain (Adeola et al, 2015). • Consider the use of progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training, relaxation response, biofeedback, emotional freedom technique, guided imagery, diaphragmatic breathing, transcendental meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness- based stress reduction, and emotional freedom technique. CEB: These are all evidence- based techniques that are easy to learn and practice and have good results in individuals with good health or with a disease ( ). EB: “CAM routines and rituals constitute key elements in cancer patients’ regular and satisfied CAM use, and they promote familial strengthening” ( ). • The practice of CAMs, both giving and receiving, can improve well-being . EBN: The patient–CAM practitioner connection is vital because it embodies healing intent, which in turn produces substantial influence on positive outcomes ( ). • See the EVOLVE website for Weblinks for client education resources.

    "pediatric": "τ Encourage early intervention. When parental depression, childhood exposure to conflict and violence, and childhood experience with abuse and neglect coexist with parental substance abuse their children are more likely to engage in increased teacher- rated unfavorable student behavioral problems. EB: Early intervention with children of substance abusers (COSA) is necessary to reach children while they are more receptive to treatment ( ). • Encourage parent communication about alcohol use with adolescents. EB: identified parent–adolescent communication as important in delaying the onset and escalation of alcohol use. τ Consider the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA), which encourages clients to become progressively involved in alternative non–substance-related pleasant social activities and to work on enhancing the enjoyment they receive within the “community” of their family and job. EB: CRA, originally developed for individuals with alcohol use disorders, has been successfully used to treat a variety of substance use disorders for more than 35 years. Based on operant conditioning, CRA helps adolescents rearrange their lifestyles so that healthy, drug-free living becomes rewarding and thereby competes with alcohol and drug use ( ). τ Educate family members about available educational and support programs and encourage no/limited alcohol use in the home. EBN: Both individual and multiperson interventions exert an influential role in family-based therapy for treatment of adolescent drug abuse ( ). • Encourage adolescents to attend a 12-step program. EB: demonstrated that adolescents who attend 12-step groups after alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment are more likely to remain abstinent and to avoid relapse. • Provide interactive school-based drug-prevention program to middle school students. EB: A meta-analysis found support for the use of interactive school-based programs to prevent cannabis use among middle school students in North America ( ).",
    "geriatric": "• Include the assessment of possible alcohol abuse when assessing older family members. EB: Alcohol abuse and dependence in older people are important problems that frequently remain undetected by health services ( ). The majority of older alcoholics are married, have low education levels, and do not belong to high social classes ( ).",
    "multicultural": "• Acknowledge racial/ethnic differences at the onset of care. EBN: Acknowledgment of race/ethnicity issues will enhance communication, establish rapport, and promote treatment outcomes ( ). • Use a family-centered approach when working with Latino, Asian American, African American, and Native American clients. EBN: American Indian families may be extended structures that could exert powerful influences over functioning ( ). Family therapy is important in addressing the needs of Hispanic families with adolescent substance abusers ( ). • Some less acculturated Latino families may be unwilling to discuss family issues with health care providers until they perceive a close personal relationship with the provider. EBN: Some Latino families may believe that personal problems should be kept private and may not respond to the health care provider until there is an established personal relationship ( ). • Work with families in a way that incorporates cultural elements. CEB: Activities such as tundra walks and time with older adults supported in treatment were used successfully for substance abuse treatment with Yup'ik and Cup'ik Eskimos ( ).",
    "home_care": [
      "Note: In the community setting, alcoholism as a cause of dysfunctional family processes must be considered in two categories: (1) when the client suffers personally from the illness, and (2) when a significant other suffers from the illness, that is, the client is not the active alcoholic but may depend on the alcoholic for caregiving. The following considerations apply to both situations with appropriate adaptation for the circumstances. • The previous interventions may be adapted for home care use. • Work with family members to support a sense of valued fit on their part",
      "include them in treatment planning and identify the importance of their roles in the client's care. At the same time, encourage the pursuit of positive outside activities that enhance their sense of belonging. CEBN: Sense of belonging (valued fit) has been identified as a buffer to depression among both depressed and nondepressed individuals with a family history of alcoholism. A buffering effect was not found for individuals with a family history of drug abuse ( ). • Educate client and family regarding the interactions of alcohol use with medications and the therapeutic regimen. Increased awareness of drug interactions decreases the chance of relapse caused by over-the-counter and other medications ( ). τ Refer for psychiatric home health care services for client reassurance and implementation of therapeutic regimen. CEB: Twelve studies (five randomized controlled trials, one quasi-experimental study, and six uncontrolled cohort studies) found that home and community-based treatment of psychiatric symptoms of socially isolated older adults with mental illness was associated with improved or maintained psychiatric status. All randomized controlled trials reported improved depressive symptoms, and one reported improved overall psychiatric symptoms ( ). τ Consider the use of a smartphone-based intervention for alcohol use disorders. Participants in a pilot study indicated the smartphone provided numerous features for addressing ongoing drinking, craving, connection with supportive others, managing life problems, high-risk location alerting, and activity scheduling. These intervention modules were helpful in highlighting alcohol use patterns. Tools related to managing alcohol craving, monitoring consumption, and identifying triggers to drink were rated by participants as particularly helpful. Participants also demonstrated significant reductions in hazardous alcohol use while using the system ( )."

      "• Suggest that the client complete a confidential Internet self-screening test for identification of problems and suggestions for treatment if a problem with alcohol is suspected. Many tools are available. These screenings help individuals to assess their own alcohol consumption patterns to determine whether their drinking is likely harming their health or increasing their risk for future harm. Education and referrals urge those whose drinking is harmful or hazardous to take positive action and informs all adults who consume alcohol about guidelines and caveats for lower risk drinking ( ). • Provide education for the family. EB: Family education facilitates understanding of the disease and its causes, effects, and treatment ( ). • Facilitate participation in mutual help groups (MHGs). EB: MHGs appear to mobilize the same change processes, such as coping, motivation, and self-efficacy, which are mobilized by many different types of professionally led groups ( ).

      "• Evaluate fatigue in geriatric clients routinely, particularly in clients with limited physical function and lower levels of social support. Chronic conditions related to age can contribute to fatigue in the geriatric client, such as cancer, dyspnea, anemia, multiple medication usage and side effects from medication, depression, insomnia ( ), nutritional deficiencies, electrolyte imbalance, and comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( ) and cardiac disease ( ). Older adults report fatigue that limits physical function, sleep, and social ability, which can aggravate comorbid conditions. Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms experienced by clients living with chronic conditions. • Review medications to determine possible side effects or interaction effects that could cause fatigue. EB: The aging process changes the way an individual absorbs, metabolizes, and eliminates medications, leaving the geriatric client susceptible to medication side effects and medication-to-medication interactions that can cause fatigue and other conditions. • Review comorbid conditions that may contribute to fatigue, such as CHF, pulmonary disease, cardiac disease, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, obesity, anemia, depression, Parkinson's disease, insomnia, and cancer. • Identify recent losses and even loss of function",
      "monitor for depression or loneliness as a possible contributing factor to fatigue. EB: There is a strong correlation between depression and fatigue in clients after a stroke ( ) and other chronic conditions. • Review other symptoms the client may be experiencing. Fatigue is often associated with other symptom clusters such as depression and sleep disturbances (",
      ").Clusters may be independent of age ( ). τ Review medications for side effects. Certain medications (e.g., diuretics with associated loss of potassium, antihypertensives, antihistamines, pain medications [ ], anticonvulsants, chemotherapeutic agents, psychiatric medications, and corticosteroids) may cause fatigue in older adults. Fatigue is a major component of FRAILTY Scales ( )."

      "The previously mentioned interventions may be adapted for home care use as well. • Assess the client's history and current patterns of fatigue as they relate to the home environment and environmental and behavioral triggers of increased fatigue. CEB: Fatigue may be more pronounced in specific settings for physical, environmental (e.g., stairs required to reach bathroom, patterns of movement around home, cleaning activities that require high energy), or psychological reasons ( ). Frailty may be related for the elderly. τ Encourage planned exercise regimens or physical activities such as walking or light aerobic exercises. This activity can be organized in the home or in a setting such as senior centers or wellness facilities. EB: Continued physical activity after cancer treatment has been associated with improved functioning in both physical and social realms ( ). After a stroke frail elderly also responded to an individualized exercise program",
      "they also had increased physical endurance and self-efficacy ( ). τ Refer to occupational and/or physical therapy if substantial intervention is needed to assist the client in adapting to home and daily patterns. EB: Interventions in older adults led by occupational and physical therapists have been associated with less difficulty in ADLs and instrumental ADLs, which may lead to lower levels of fatigue ( ). Occupational and physical therapy rehabilitation have also been shown to decrease fatigue in cancer survivors ( ). Home-based exercise in stage IV lung and colorectal clients has shown improvement in levels of fatigue ( ). • For clients receiving chemotherapy, intervene to: ❍ Relieve symptom distress (anxiety, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite, emotional distress, difficulty sleeping). ❍ Encourage as much physical activity as possible with a specific recommendation ( ). • Teach the client and family the importance of and methods for setting priorities for activities, especially those with high energy demand (e.g., home or family events). Instruct in realistic expectations and behavioral pacing. EBN: Prioritization of activities can be effective in restoring energy ( ). ❍ Identify with the client ways in which he or she continues to be a valued part of his or her social environment. ❍ Identify with the client ways in which he or she continues to participate in preferred daily activity or social activities. ❍ Encourage the client to maintain regular family routines (e.g., meals, sleep patterns) as much as possible."

Consider using diluted oral rehydration fluids. Once the child is rehydrated, an orally administered maintenance solution should be used along with food. EB: A study demonstrated that treatment with oral rehydration fluids for children was generally as effective as IV fluids, and IV fluids did not shorten the duration of gastroenteritis and are more likely to cause adverse effects than oral rehydration therapy ( ). EB: Many studies have shown that diluted oral replacement fluids and some drugs resulted in reductions in stool output, decreased vomiting, and less need for IV hydration ( ). • Recommend that the mother resume breastfeeding as soon as possible. • Recommend that parents not give the child carbonated soda, fruit juices, gelatin dessert, or instant fruit drink mix",

      "• Monitor older clients for deficient fluid volume carefully, noting new onset of headache, weakness, dizziness, and postural hypotension. Older people are thought to be at greater risk of dehydration because thirst sensation and urinary concentrating ability frequently decline with age. Many older people use diuretics or laxatives, which encourage fluid loss, and reduced muscle volume leads to a smaller fluid reserve. Oral fluid intake may fall in older people for a variety of reasons including reduced enjoyment of drinks, physical limitations, unmet activities of daily living needs, acute and chronic health problems, and decisions aimed at controlling continence ( ). Additionally those with dementia may forget to drink as daily routines are lost and social contact diminishes. • Implement fall precautions for clients experiencing weakness, dizziness, and/or postural hypotension. Falls are a serious risk in the elderly, especially those with hyponatremia ( ). • Evaluate the risk for dehydration using the Dehydration Risk Appraisal Checklist. CEB: A study demonstrated that the checklist has potential to predict the onset of dehydration in nursing home clients ( ). • Check skin turgor of older clients on the forehead and axilla",
      "check for dry mucous membranes and dry tongue. EB: A Cochrane review recommended in clinical practice to avoid the reliance on one clinical symptom as a sign of water-loss dehydration in older people ( ). Older adults are susceptible to dehydration because of acute and chronic health problems, which impair thirst",
      "reduce the ability to drink sufficiently",
      "and/or increase urinary, skin, and respiratory fluid loss (",
      "). Older adults present with a constellation of signs and symptoms that need to be further evaluated for connection to dehydration. Signs and symptoms include fatigue, pallor, sunken periorbital area, chapped lips, hypotension, tachycardia, fever, orthostatic blood pressure, weight loss >4%, poor skin turgor over the sternum, and change in mental status ( ). • Encourage fluid intake by offering fluids regularly to cognitively impaired clients. EB: The single most common risk factor reported associated with dehydration in cognitively impaired clients was a worsening or change in mental state ( ). • Because older clients have low water reserves, they should be encouraged to drink regularly even when not thirsty. Frequent and varied beverage offerings should be made available by hydration assistants to routinely offer increased beverages to clients in extended care. EB: Strategies to improve fluid intake include making healthy drinks and water easily available and accessible at all times and reminding and encouraging older adults to consume these fluids. Older people should not be encouraged to consume large amounts of fluids at once but rather small amounts throughout the day ( ). • Flag the food tray of clients with chronic dehydration to indicate if the client is identified as having chronic dehydration and indicate that they should finish 75% to 100% of their food and fluids. Offering beverages in brightly colored cups may improve fluid intake. Older clients often have a combination of both malnutrition and fluid deficit and may not have good taste sensation ( ). • Recognize that lower blood pressures and monitoring of an intake record over 24 hours is recommended to track oral intake and possible dehydration ( Oates et al, 2015 ). • A higher BUN/creatinine ratio can be significant signs of dehydration in older adults. Structural changes of the kidney include alterations of renal blood flow of up to 50% from age 20 to 80. As people age, the kidney undergoes age-related changes, which translate in an inexorable and progressive decline in renal function. • In the United States, renal dysfunction has a 15% prevalence in persons older than 70 years ( ). • Monitor older clients for excess fluid volume during the treatment of deficient fluid volume: auscultate lung sounds, assess for edema, and note vital signs. The older client has a decreased ability to adapt to rapid increases in intravascular volume and can quickly develop fluid overload."

Instruct them to monitor both intake and output. Use common terms such as “cups” or “glasses of water a day” when providing education. • When weighing the client, use same scale each day. Be sure scale is on a flat, not cushioned, surface. Do not weigh the client with a scale placed on any type of rug because scales provide more accurate readings when used on a hard surface. • Teach family about complications of deficient fluid volume and when to call the health care provider. • Teach the family the signs of hypovolemia, especially in older adults, and how to monitor for dizziness or unsteady gait. • If the client is receiving IV fluids, there must be a responsible caregiver in the home. Teach caregiver about administration of fluids, complications of IV administration (e.g., fluid volume overload, development of phlebitis, speed of medication reactions), and when to call for assistance. Assist caregiver with administration for as long as necessary to maintain client safety. Administration of IV fluids in the home is a high- technology procedure and requires sufficient professional support to ensure safety of the client. • Identify an emergency plan, including when to call 911. Some complications of deficient fluid volume cannot be reversed in the home and are life-threatening. Clients progressing toward hypovolemic shock will need emergency care. • Deficient fluid volume may be a symptom of impending death in terminally ill clients. In palliative care situations, treatment of deficient fluid volume should be determined based on client/family goals. Information and support should be provided to assist the client/family in this decision. Support the family/client in a palliative care situation to decide if it is appropriate to intervene for deficient fluid volume or to allow the client to die without fluids. Deficient fluid volume may be a symptom of impending death in terminally ill clients.

EB: The kidney undergoes age-related changes that include structural and functional changes, which may increase the incidence of AKI ( ). • Monitor electrolyte levels carefully, including sodium levels and potassium levels , with both increased and decreased levels possible. Older adults are prone to electrolyte abnormalities caused by aging, decreased muscle mass, and decreased total body water ( ). Also, the large number of medications that are taken can affect electrolyte levels. Many older clients receive selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for treatment of depression, which can result in hyponatremia ( ). SSRIs are also known to be responsible for many sexual side effects such as altered libido, erectile dysfunction, vaginal dryness, ejaculatory disorders, and orgasmic problems, which are frequently reported by patients ( ). • Refer to the care plan for and the care plan for",

Assist family with integrating restrictions into daily living. Assistance with integration of cultural values, especially those related to foods, with medical regimen promotes compliance and decreased risk of complications. τ Teach and reinforce knowledge of medications. Instruct the client not to use over- the-counter (OTC) medications (e.g., diet medications) without first consulting the provider. τ Instruct the client to make the primary health care provider aware of medications ordered by other health care providers. • Identify emergency plan for rapidly developing or critical levels of excess fluid volume when diuresing is not safe at home. Excess fluid volume can be life-threatening. τ Teach about signs and symptoms of both excess and deficient fluid volume, such as darker urine, dry mouth, and peripheral edema, and when to call the health care provider. Urine color may be a simple indicator of hydration ( ).",

      "• Describe signs and symptoms of excess fluid volume and actions to take if they occur. τ Teach client on diuretics to weigh self daily in the morning and to notify the health care provider if there is a 2.2 pound (1 kg) or more weight gain ( ). EB: Clinical practice guidelines on HF suggest that daily weight monitoring leads to early recognition of excess fluid retention, which, when reported, can be offset with additional medication to avoid hospitalization caused by HF decompensation ( ). τ Teach the importance of fluid and sodium restrictions. Help the client and family devise a schedule for intake of fluids throughout the entire day. Refer to a dietitian concerning implementation of a low-sodium diet. • Teach clients how to measure and document intake and output with common household measurements, such as cups. τ Teach how to take diuretics correctly: take one dose in the morning and second dose (if taken) no later than 4 p.m. Adjust potassium intake as appropriate for potassium- losing or potassium-sparing diuretics. Note the appearance of side effects such as weakness, muscle cramps, hypertension, or palpitations ( ). • For the client undergoing hemodialysis, teach client the required restrictions in dietary electrolytes, protein, and fluid. Spend time with the client to detect any factors that may interfere with the client's compliance with the fluid restriction or restrictive diet. EBN: Nonadherence to fluid restrictions, especially in patients undergoing hemodialysis, has been linked to numerous deleterious outcomes, including patient and provider frustration, treatment failure, illness complications and relapse, and mortality ( ).

CEB: The process family or loved ones uses to prepare the child for separation plays a central role in how the child makes meaning of and responds to the challenge of separation, for example, feeling abandoned when separation is not framed as temporary and needed versus feeling resilient when separation is framed otherwise ( ). • Explore acculturation process-related stress, social support, and ethnic identity of youth. EB: Evidence supports that the increase in acculturative stress over time increases the internalizing of mental health symptoms",

Rushing to the toilet increases physical pressure on the bladder, enhances the sensation of fullness, exposes the client to visual cues that can trigger incontinence, and exacerbates urgency ( ). • Teach the client the following techniques: ❍ When a strong or precipitous urge to urinate is perceived, teach the client to avoid running to the toilet. ❍ Pause, sit down, and relax the entire body. ❍ Perform repeated, rapid pelvic muscle contractions until the urge is relieved. ❍ Use distraction: count backward from 100 by sevens",

      "and take five deep breaths, focusing on breathing. ❍ Relief is followed by micturition within 5 to 15 minutes, using nonhurried movements when locating a toilet and voiding. ❍ Use urge suppression strategies on waking during the night. If the urge subsides, the client should be encouraged to go back to sleep. If after a minute or two the urge does not subside, clients should be instructed to get up to void to avoid sleep interruption. EB: Behavioral training for urge incontinence can reduce nocturia ( ). • Teach the client to self-administer antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) drugs as directed. Teach dosage side effects and administration of the medication and the importance of combining pharmacotherapy with scheduled voiding, adequate fluid intake, restriction of bladder irritants, and urge suppression techniques. EB: Antimuscarinic drugs increase bladder capacity, reduce the frequency of incontinence episodes, and diminish voiding frequency. However, they do not cure bladder dysfunction or reduce the time between perception of a strong urge and onset of an overactive detrusor contraction. Approximately two-thirds of clients treated with antimuscarinic medication discontinue use within 3 to 4 months",

If the client has been taking over-the-counter medications or home remedies, it is important to consider their influence. • Instruct the caregiver to provide clothing that is nonrestrictive, can be manipulated easily for toileting, and can be changed with ease. Avoidance of complicated maneuvers increases the chance of success in toileting programs and decreases the client's risk for embarrassing incontinent episodes. • Evaluate self-care strategies of community-dwelling older adults, strengthen adaptive behaviors, and counsel older adults about altering strategies that compromise general health. • Assist the family in arranging care in a way that allows the client to participate in family or favorite activities without embarrassment. Careful planning can both help the client retain dignity and maintain integrity of family patterns. τ If the client is limited to bed (or bed and chair), provide a commode or bedpan that can be easily accessed. Involve occupational and physical therapy services as indicated to promote safe transfers. τ If the client is frequently incontinent, refer for home health aide services to assist with hygiene and skin care. τ Refer the family to support services to assist with in-home management of fecal incontinence as indicated.

      "). • Cluster nursing procedures to decrease number of contacts with infants, allowing time for appropriate hand hygiene. EBN: Audit programs to track compliance with hand hygiene identified a drop in the incidence of health care–associated infections in very low-birth- weight infants in the neonatal intensive care unit ( ). • Avoid the prophylactic use of topical cream in premature infants. CEB: Prophylactic application of topical ointment increases the risk of coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection and any health care–acquired infection. A trend toward increased risk of any bacterial infection was noted in infants treated prophylactically ( ). • Encourage early enteral feeding with human milk. Human milk enhances immune defenses of the infant ( ). τ Monitor recurrent antibiotic use in children. • Instruct parents on appropriate indicators for medical visits and the risks associated with overuse of antibiotics. EB: Guidelines addressing treatment of asthma in children state that antibiotics should not be used as part of chronic asthma therapy or for acute exacerbations, with the exception of clients with comorbid bacterial infections such as pneumonia or sinusitis ( )."

In long-term care facilities, the risk for pneumonia ranges from 0.3 to 2.5 events per 1000 resident-days ( ). • Most clients develop health care–associated pneumonia (HCAP) by either aspirating contaminated substances or inhaling airborne particles. Refer to care plan for Risk for Aspiration. τ Carefully screen older women with incontinence for urinary tract infections. CEB: Consider alternatives to chronic indwelling catheters, such as intermittent catheterization. CAUTI has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital cost, and length of stay ( ). • Observe and report if the client has a low-grade fever or new onset of confusion. EB: Those caring for older clients must be alerted to the potential presence of infection when even low-grade temperature elevations appear for short periods ( ) . • Recommend that the geriatric client receive an annual influenza immunization and one-time pneumococcal vaccine. EB: Immunization against influenza is an effective intervention that reduces serologically confirmed cases ( , ). • Recognize that chronically ill geriatric clients have an increased susceptibility to C. difficile infection",

Using good hand hygiene practices is effective for preventing these infections ( ). τ Encourage high-risk persons, including health care workers, to get vaccinated ( ). τ Influenza: Teach symptoms of influenza and the importance of vaccination for influenza. EB: Everyone 6 months of age and older should get the flu vaccine. Seasonal flu vaccine is effective and has a very good safety track record ( , ). Teach the client and family how to take a temperature. Encourage the family to take the client's temperature between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. at least once daily.

    "geriatric": "• Consider the physiological changes in the aging population. The aging workforce typically has experienced changes in their physical systems that require attention to physical needs. These changes may include slower reaction times, predisposing factors to developing musculoskeletal disorders, a compromised cardiovascular system, less acute hearing and vision, and impaired cognition ( ). • Although older clients may experience less occupational injuries and illnesses, the aging workforce may take longer to heal injuries and return to work and normal functioning. EB: A review of current best practices by found that the extent of age-related physical changes in older workers is significantly influenced by chronic illnesses. However, improving lifestyles could reduce organizational costs, and reducing costs is important because although older worker statistics report lower work-related injury rates, their recovery is slower and lost work time is longer. Also, identifying ergonomic risk factors will assist in workplace design improvements in workplace to reduce risks of musculoskeletal disorders for the aging population ( ).",
    "multicultural": [
      "• Address differences in cultures that affect attitudes toward health care professionals and treatment modalities. Understanding the written and verbal language can significantly affect the instructions and training given to workers. • According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ), young workers have high rates of job-related injury. These injuries are often the result of the many hazards present in the places they typically work, such as sharp knives and slippery floors in restaurants. Limited or no prior work experience and a lack of safety training also contribute to high injury rates. Middle and high school workers may be at increased risk for injury because they may not have the strength or cognitive ability needed to perform certain job duties. In 2016, there were about 19.3 million workers under the age of 24. These workers represented 13% of the total workforce, and in 2015, 403 workers under the age of 24 died from work-related injuries ( ). • The US workforce is becoming more diverse ( ). Baby boomers are remaining in the workforce past traditional retirement age because their health is better, and they need or want additional income ( ). Physical changes occur with the aging workforce that need to be addressed, such as decreased visual acuity that requires increased lighting, decreased hearing from presbycusis, difficulty with balance, and increase in healing time from musculoskeletal injuries. EB: According to a study by , issues were explored related to the aging workforce, including barriers to integrating health promotion and protection programs to provide recommendations for best practices to maximize contributions of that worker population. Reducing injury costs is important because although older worker statistics report lower work-related injury rates, their recovery is slower and lost work time is longer. The conclusion was a national dialog on this topic was needed, and the result will be that workers will benefit from improved health and job performance, employers will have more productive and engaged workers, and the United States will have a more competitive workforce ( ). • The size of the minority workforce is growing, and more women are entering the workforce ( ). There is greater diversity in the workplace, and people from different backgrounds and cultures are working alongside each other, often speaking different languages with different educational and literacy backgrounds. EB: As the minority workforce continues to grow, especially the Hispanic workforce, businesses must recognize the unique needs and contributions of this workforce in terms of language, customs, culture, and values ( ). According to , results of a study on Latino day workers add to the growing body of research documenting the higher prevalence of work-related health complaints or injuries among those workers with work-related health complaints or injuries who were older, reporting poor or fair general physical and mental health, and more likely than those without health complaints or injury, to work in pain during the prior work week without work breaks. Most health complaints or injuries were unreported. Those that occurred within the prior year experienced a higher prevalence of depression and arthritis compared with their counterparts without work-related health complaints or injuries in the prior year. Recommendations were that occupational health nurses should promote the health of and prevent injuries among this group of vulnerable workers at both the individual and system levels. • Depending on the setting, comprehensive health care, including, for example, smoking cessation and early diagnosis and treatment of depression, could be provided to this high-risk population using culturally sensitive outreach and motivational interviewing strategies. EB: Because of underreporting, active case findings for occupational injuries are needed when day laborers access any health care system. To ensure the provision of health and safety training and PPE for day laborers at the system level, occupational health nurses can advocate for comprehensive occupational health and safety legal protections for all contingent workers. Reporting health complaints and injuries, in addition to providing rest breaks, deserves further study in this population. In addition to targeted hearing conservation and respiratory protection programs for this high-risk group, the risk of falls from heights is a serious hazard facing day laborers, and this phenomenon also deserves further investigation ( ). • As women continue to earn significantly less than their male counterparts, they may believe that they need to work harder to prove themselves to earn the promotions and higher pay scales. The nurse may recognize these situational stressors and need to refer female employees more than the male employees for counseling, such as initiating assistance offered by employee assistance programs or community resources for family support. • The (ADA) requires that public buildings be designed to accommodate wheelchairs and other accommodations and that jobs be modified if accommodation is reasonable, so more challenged individuals gain access to buildings and jobs (see [ADA]).

      "• Consider the health literacy and the readiness to learn for all clients and caregivers (e.g., mental acuity, ability to see or hear, existing pain, emotional readiness, motivation, previous knowledge). EBN: A new study looking at a new tool, the Newest Vital Sign (NVS), was used to measure the patient’s health literacy. Findings showed that this tool is efficient to administer and could help identify low health literacy patients ( ). • Focus on the nature of spoken and written communication when teaching clients and caregivers, especially those who may have health literacy needs. EBN: provided an overview of tools for effective teaching communication including providing feedback, actively seeking questions, using a teach-back method, and providing age-appropriate client education materials that are in are written in everyday layman’s language. EBN: A recent qualitative study explored the relationship between health literacy and effective communication. One of the overarching themes was that building trust and relationships with the older adults to achieve effective communication can then be applied to meet the individual health literacy needs of the patient ( ). • Consider the context, timing, and order of how information is presented. CEB: A systematic review of 56 studies on educational interventions found that presenting the most important information first and the use of simplifying, “chunking,” and grouping information presented in short sessions were effective ( ). • Use client-centered approaches that engage clients and caregivers as active versus passive learners. EB: A systematic review of 38 trials with clients with asthma found that using empathy-building strategies within a framework of person-centered counseling would maximize the effectiveness of self-care interventions for those with poorly controlled asthma ( ). • Reinforce learning through frequent repetition and follow-up sessions. EBN: A systematic review of six studies found that frequent and regular educational sessions, including “boost” sessions, improved medication and self-care management outcomes for those with a chronic condition, including stroke clients ( ). EBN: In a qualitative study with semistructured interviews, it was discovered that patients who were in the intensive care unit (ICU) and who attended a follow-up session were better able to process their feelings and emotions. The findings from this study supported the hypothesis that the follow-up session for an ICU patient can aid in processing the illness after the fact ( ). • Use electronic methods for delivery of information when appropriate. EB: A Cochrane review of 24 studies with 8112 participants found that the use of multimedia education (video, audio, and self-paced computer programs) as an adjunct with current programs was most effective ( ). EB: In a Cochrane review of 16 trials with 3478 participants, the use of computer programs and the use of mobile phone interventions helped clients with diabetes type 2 improve blood glucose control, although not all clients have access ( ). • Help the client and caregivers locate appropriate postdischarge groups and resources. EBN: A recent systematic review concluded that the utilization of postdischarge support for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) significantly reduced the readmission rates within 30 days and had an effect up to 180 days ( ). • Encourage clients and caregivers to maintain and/or expand supportive social networks as self-care learning resources when appropriate. EB: In a longitudinal study of 300 patients with long-term chronic health conditions, those who had sustained or expanded community networks were more likely to sustain self-care management, maintain behavioral change and treatment regimens, and access voluntary caregiving over formal caregiving ( ). • Use family-centered approaches when teaching children and adolescents. EBN: According to , when families are educated about the patient and know what to expect during the transition out of the ICU, their fears and anxieties are decreased, which can promote healing for the patient. • Guide children and adolescents to credible information about their condition. EBN: A recent mixed methods study showed that the best way to inform adolescents about HIV and sexual/reproductive health is via the radio, television, mass media, and social media ( ). • Educate all older clients on safety issues, including fall prevention and medication management. QSEN: In a meta-analysis of 19 studies, clients receiving targeted fall prevention education face to face or through multimedia methods had decrease in falls from those either receiving no formal education or written education ( ). • Use multidisciplinary teams to enhance patient education. EBN: A qualitative study exploring medication management in people with dementia showed potential positive benefits of a community pharmacist working in a multidisciplinary environment outside the pharmacy and can improve medication management ( ). • Consider using teaching methods and materials appropriate for older adults, especially those with cognitive challenges. EBN: A recent study concluded that screening for cognitive impairment in the elderly population and including the family and caregivers in the discharge education has the potential to minimize the risk of readmission ( ). • Assess readiness of older adults for use of technological resources. EBN: Health care providers need to assess the experience and willingness of older adults to use the Internet as a source of health information, and Internet sites need to be assessed for readability, large fonts, and simple structure ( ). • Use educational interventions that are culturally tailored to the health literacy needs of the client. A Cochrane review of 33 randomized controlled trials focusing on diabetes type 2 found that culturally appropriate health education improved blood sugar control among participants, compared with those receiving the “usual” care, at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the intervention ( ). • Assess for cultural/ethnic self-care practices. CEB: The knowledge of patients’ cultural practices can be used by health care providers to help design more culturally competent care for the patient ( ). • Consider the potential influence of medical interpreters in information sharing and decision-making and of the possible difficulties for clients when using medical interpreters. EBN: The use of medical interpreters can help bridge the culture and language gap, allowing patients to feel more comfortable expressing themselves ( ). • Consider involving bilingual members of a community who are considered outside the traditional health care system who may assist in the teaching of community health issues. EBN: A recent cross-sectional design study examined challenges associated with migrant and English-speaking cancer patients and found that the majority of participants in all migrant groups reported difficulty communicating with the health care providers and team in English ( ). • All of the previously mentioned interventions are applicable to the home setting. • Use telehealth and technology-enhanced practices as appropriate. EBN: Findings from a literature review of 48 papers supported previous findings that technology is desired by consumers and can be effective, but the appropriateness for use should take into consideration the abilities of the clients, as well as the credibility of software applications and the accessibility of the type of technology, including computers and mobile devices ( ). EBN: A recent review of 11 studies looking at the role of telehealth in diabetic foot ulcer management found that telehealth was well received by patients and providers",

EB: A meta-analysis found exercise beneficial in increasing gait speed and improving balance and ADL performance ( ). Mobilization should occur at least three times daily, mobilization should be progressive and scaled, and assessment should take place within 24 hours of admission ( ). • Use the FFC rehabilitative philosophy of care in older adults to prevent avoidable functional decline.

EBN: The risk of declines in functional status when older adults are hospitalized requires using evidence-based strategies to reduce the incidence and effect of decreased mobility, pressure ulcers, pain, dehydration, malnutrition, and sequelae of invasive treatments ( ). • Use gestures and nonverbal cues when helping clients move if they are anxious or have difficulty understanding and following verbal instructions. Nonverbal gestures are part of a universal language that can be understood when the client is having difficulty with communication. • Recognize that wheelchairs are not a good mobility device and often serve as a mobility restraint. • Ensure that chairs fit clients. Chair seat should be 3 inches above the height of the knee. Provide a raised toilet seat if needed. Raising the height of a chair can dramatically improve the ability of many older clients to stand up. Low, deep, soft seats with armrests that are far apart reduce a person's ability to get up and down without help. • If the client is mainly immobile, provide opportunities for socialization and sensory stimulation (e.g., television and visits). Refer to the care plan for Deficient Diversional activity. • Recognize that immobility and a lack of social support and sensory input may result in confusion or depression in older adults. Refer to nursing interventions for Acute Confusion or Hopelessness as appropriate."

EB: Use the Home Safety Self-Assessment Tool to identify fall risk, prevent falls, and improve mobility and function ( ). ▲ Refer to home health aide services to support the client and family through changing levels of mobility. Reinforce need to promote independence in mobility as tolerated. Providing unnecessary assistance with transfers, bathing, and dressing activities may promote dependence and a loss of mobility rather than optimizing a person's underlying physical capability. Such attentive care may actually prevent older adults from using their remaining abilities ( ). ▲ Refer to physical therapy for gait training, strengthening, and balance training. Physical therapists can provide direct interventions and assess need for assistive devices (e.g., cane, walker) ( ). • Assess skin condition at every visit. Establish a skin care program that enhances circulation and maximizes position changes. Impaired mobility decreases circulation to dependent areas. Decreased circulation and shearing place the client at risk for skin breakdown. • Once the client is able to walk independently, suggest that the client enter an exercise program, or walk with a friend. CEB: Nurse practitioners providing primary care should prescribe regular physical activity to minimize progressive impaired mobility ( ). • Provide support to the client and family/caregivers during long-term impaired mobility.

Refer to the care plan for Sedentary lifestyle or Rationales for motivational interviewing. • Teach the client and caregivers processes and tools used during care to use at home to assess fall risk and promote progressive mobility. Involve them in planning for these activities at home. EBN: Few studies have investigated the point of view of older patients on prevention of this decline. Within the framework of a descriptive qualitative study, the perceptions of 30 hospitalized older adults were collected regarding their personal prevention strategies, the barriers to implementing these, and nursing staff interventions deemed useful. Results show that participants are sensitive to the risk of functional decline and use various preventive strategies particularly to maintain their physical abilities, maintain good spirits, keep a clear mind, and foster nutrition and sleep. Their strategies are difficult to implement because of internal and external barriers. Nursing interventions deemed useful are good relational approach, strong basic care, appropriate assessment, and respect for level of autonomy.

EB: This study aimed to define the role of nutritional interventions in the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in head and neck cancer clients undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and their effect on CRT- related toxicity and survival. Head and neck cancer clients are frequently malnourished at the time of diagnosis and prior to the beginning of treatment. In addition, CRT causes or exacerbates symptoms, such as alteration or loss of taste, mucositis, xerostomia, fatigue, and nausea and vomiting, with consequent worsening of malnutrition. Nutritional counseling and oral nutritional supplements should be used to increase dietary intake and prevent therapy- associated weight loss and interruption of radiation therapy ( ). Some of the symptoms (e.g., fatigue, loss of taste) are also present in clients with the diagnostic concept “impaired mood regulation.” This study clearly demonstrates that nutritional counseling should be used to increase dietary intake and to prevent weight loss. • Encourage regular physical exercise to maintain or advance to a higher level of fitness and health. EB: Negative affective states such as anxiety, depression, and stress are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease, particularly in cardiac and postcardiac rehabilitation populations. In this study, yoga is used as physical exercise. Breathing control and meditation can reduce psychosocial symptoms and improve cardiovascular and cognitive function ( ). This study showed the interest of physical exercise to advance a higher level of health. • This intervention can be substantiated by and . • Reduce the risk of self-inflicted harm for a client in crisis or severe depression with a planned treatment program. CEB/EBN: This study is about childhood suicidal behavior. This is a complex symptom that requires a carefully planned treatment program that includes multiple modalities of care. Treatment requires a long-term approach that constantly reassesses potential for serious suicidal risk. Psychiatric hospitalization may be required to protect the child from self-inflicted harm and to allow evaluation and appropriate intervention ( ). This study is not recent, but it confirms that the risk of self-inflicted harm for a client in crisis should be reduced. • Advise the client to listen to music in a negative mood (",
      "). • Try to perceive possible suicidal thoughts on time ( ). • Enable the client to express his or her feelings and try to support the client emotionally if necessary ( ). • When possible, use (aromatherapy) massage when in a negative mood (",
      "). • Consider recommending cognitive behavior therapy (",
      "). • Consider recommending psychotherapy ( ). • Give the client hope, for example, about regaining his or her health ( ). • If necessary, emphasize the importance of daily activity and routine ( ). • Signal and treat pain on time ( ). • Promote the self-efficacy of the client ( ). • In case of a persistent negative mood, recommend meditation to theclient ( ). • The use of a doll in people with dementia can contribute to a better mood ( ). • Provide a treatment involving the cooperation of several aid workers in neighborhood teams and providing customized treatment at the place in which the client resides. EB/EBN: The use of teams is a well-known approach in a variety of settings, including health care, in both developed and developing countries. Team performance comprises teamwork and task work, and ascertaining whether a team is performing as expected to achieve the desired outcome has rarely been done in health care settings in resource-limited countries ( ).

Symptoms of dry mouth are more common in menopausal women and almost 50% of the elderly population because of an age-related increase of systemic disease occurrence and disease treatment, including medications (",

EB: Systematic review of the literature from 1980 to 2010 indicates a high prevalence of xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction in the very elderly population with associated factors of polypharmacy, poor general health, and old age ( ). • Older adults are at risk of xerostomia from a variety of etiologies. EB: In a narrative review of systemic disease in older adults and review of the literature of xerostomia caused by various etiologies, it is recommended to assess the patient for dehydration, nutritional alteration manifested by weight loss, decreased appetite, increased thirst, and any changes in food or beverage preferences. Oral symptoms of malnutrition, such as sore tongue, burning mouth, and gingivitis, may be caused by iron, vitamin B 1 , B 2 , B 6 , and B 12 or vitamin C deficiencies (",

EB: In a cross-sectional study to examine the relationship between nutrition, oral health, and drug use among adults aged 75 and older, it was found that excessive polypharmacy, the use of particular drug groups, and depressive symptoms were associated with xerostomia, supporting the need for a multidisciplinary approach to care (Thompson 2015",
