      "• Consider the health literacy and the readiness to learn for all clients and caregivers (e.g., mental acuity, ability to see or hear, existing pain, emotional readiness, motivation, previous knowledge). EBN: A new study looking at a new tool, the Newest Vital Sign (NVS), was used to measure the patient’s health literacy. Findings showed that this tool is efficient to administer and could help identify low health literacy patients ( ). • Focus on the nature of spoken and written communication when teaching clients and caregivers, especially those who may have health literacy needs. EBN: provided an overview of tools for effective teaching communication including providing feedback, actively seeking questions, using a teach-back method, and providing age-appropriate client education materials that are in are written in everyday layman’s language. EBN: A recent qualitative study explored the relationship between health literacy and effective communication. One of the overarching themes was that building trust and relationships with the older adults to achieve effective communication can then be applied to meet the individual health literacy needs of the patient ( ). • Consider the context, timing, and order of how information is presented. CEB: A systematic review of 56 studies on educational interventions found that presenting the most important information first and the use of simplifying, “chunking,” and grouping information presented in short sessions were effective ( ). • Use client-centered approaches that engage clients and caregivers as active versus passive learners. EB: A systematic review of 38 trials with clients with asthma found that using empathy-building strategies within a framework of person-centered counseling would maximize the effectiveness of self-care interventions for those with poorly controlled asthma ( ). • Reinforce learning through frequent repetition and follow-up sessions. EBN: A systematic review of six studies found that frequent and regular educational sessions, including “boost” sessions, improved medication and self-care management outcomes for those with a chronic condition, including stroke clients ( ). EBN: In a qualitative study with semistructured interviews, it was discovered that patients who were in the intensive care unit (ICU) and who attended a follow-up session were better able to process their feelings and emotions. The findings from this study supported the hypothesis that the follow-up session for an ICU patient can aid in processing the illness after the fact ( ). • Use electronic methods for delivery of information when appropriate. EB: A Cochrane review of 24 studies with 8112 participants found that the use of multimedia education (video, audio, and self-paced computer programs) as an adjunct with current programs was most effective ( ). EB: In a Cochrane review of 16 trials with 3478 participants, the use of computer programs and the use of mobile phone interventions helped clients with diabetes type 2 improve blood glucose control, although not all clients have access ( ). • Help the client and caregivers locate appropriate postdischarge groups and resources. EBN: A recent systematic review concluded that the utilization of postdischarge support for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) significantly reduced the readmission rates within 30 days and had an effect up to 180 days ( ). • Encourage clients and caregivers to maintain and/or expand supportive social networks as self-care learning resources when appropriate. EB: In a longitudinal study of 300 patients with long-term chronic health conditions, those who had sustained or expanded community networks were more likely to sustain self-care management, maintain behavioral change and treatment regimens, and access voluntary caregiving over formal caregiving ( ). • Use family-centered approaches when teaching children and adolescents. EBN: According to , when families are educated about the patient and know what to expect during the transition out of the ICU, their fears and anxieties are decreased, which can promote healing for the patient. • Guide children and adolescents to credible information about their condition. EBN: A recent mixed methods study showed that the best way to inform adolescents about HIV and sexual/reproductive health is via the radio, television, mass media, and social media ( ). • Educate all older clients on safety issues, including fall prevention and medication management. QSEN: In a meta-analysis of 19 studies, clients receiving targeted fall prevention education face to face or through multimedia methods had decrease in falls from those either receiving no formal education or written education ( ). • Use multidisciplinary teams to enhance patient education. EBN: A qualitative study exploring medication management in people with dementia showed potential positive benefits of a community pharmacist working in a multidisciplinary environment outside the pharmacy and can improve medication management ( ). • Consider using teaching methods and materials appropriate for older adults, especially those with cognitive challenges. EBN: A recent study concluded that screening for cognitive impairment in the elderly population and including the family and caregivers in the discharge education has the potential to minimize the risk of readmission ( ). • Assess readiness of older adults for use of technological resources. EBN: Health care providers need to assess the experience and willingness of older adults to use the Internet as a source of health information, and Internet sites need to be assessed for readability, large fonts, and simple structure ( ). • Use educational interventions that are culturally tailored to the health literacy needs of the client. A Cochrane review of 33 randomized controlled trials focusing on diabetes type 2 found that culturally appropriate health education improved blood sugar control among participants, compared with those receiving the “usual” care, at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after the intervention ( ). • Assess for cultural/ethnic self-care practices. CEB: The knowledge of patients’ cultural practices can be used by health care providers to help design more culturally competent care for the patient ( ). • Consider the potential influence of medical interpreters in information sharing and decision-making and of the possible difficulties for clients when using medical interpreters. EBN: The use of medical interpreters can help bridge the culture and language gap, allowing patients to feel more comfortable expressing themselves ( ). • Consider involving bilingual members of a community who are considered outside the traditional health care system who may assist in the teaching of community health issues. EBN: A recent cross-sectional design study examined challenges associated with migrant and English-speaking cancer patients and found that the majority of participants in all migrant groups reported difficulty communicating with the health care providers and team in English ( ). • All of the previously mentioned interventions are applicable to the home setting. • Use telehealth and technology-enhanced practices as appropriate. EBN: Findings from a literature review of 48 papers supported previous findings that technology is desired by consumers and can be effective, but the appropriateness for use should take into consideration the abilities of the clients, as well as the credibility of software applications and the accessibility of the type of technology, including computers and mobile devices ( ). EBN: A recent review of 11 studies looking at the role of telehealth in diabetic foot ulcer management found that telehealth was well received by patients and providers",
      "assessments via the telehealth modalities were congruent with face-to-face assessment ( )."
